## Reflection Section

### Student Reflections on SeqTrack Inference and Evaluation

**Student 1 Reflection:**
Working with SeqTrack for inference and evaluation provided valuable insights into modern object tracking systems. The most challenging aspect was managing the complex dependencies and ensuring proper checkpoint loading across different epochs. I learned that tracking performance significantly improves with training progression, and different object classes (airplane vs coin) show distinct performance characteristics. The evaluation process revealed the importance of proper metric calculation and the need for comprehensive testing across multiple sequences.

**Student 2 Reflection:**
The SeqTrack evaluation process taught me about the practical challenges of deploying deep learning models for real-time tracking. Managing GPU memory, optimizing inference speed, and handling different sequence lengths were key learning points. I discovered that FPS improvements don't always correlate linearly with accuracy improvements, and that class-specific performance variations require careful analysis. The most rewarding part was seeing the clear training progression across epochs and understanding how transformer-based architectures perform in tracking tasks.

**Student 3 Reflection:**
Evaluating SeqTrack across all 10 epochs provided deep insights into model convergence and performance optimization. I learned that early epochs show rapid improvement, while later epochs focus on fine-tuning. The technical challenges of dependency management and result extraction taught me about the importance of robust evaluation pipelines. Most importantly, I gained understanding of how tracking metrics (IoU, Precision, AUC) evolve during training and how they relate to real-world tracking performance.
