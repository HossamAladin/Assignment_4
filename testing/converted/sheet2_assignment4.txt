Assignment 4 – SeqTrack Inference Evaluation and Report Documentation
Relation to Assignment 3
Assignment 4 is the continuation of Assignment 3.
In Assignment 3, the team trained SeqTrack on two classes, saved checkpoints, and logged training data (losses, IoU, and time statistics).
In Assignment 4, the team must use those checkpoints to run full inference and evaluation, measure performance, and prepare the final report.

Goals of Assignment 4
To apply the testing and evaluation codes provided by the official SeqTrack repository.
To perform inference on the entire testing sequences of the LaSOT dataset.
To evaluate the model’s performance for every epoch checkpoint.
To provide new tables and graphs that summarize inference performance.
To optionally include time statistics in the logs, following the format introduced in Assignment 3.
To compile results and reflections in the final team report (assignment_4.docx).

Task Instructions
Step 1 – Apply Test and Evaluation
Use the checkpoints from Assignment 3.
Apply the test and evaluation scripts provided by the SeqTrack repository.
Run inference on the entire testing sequences of LaSOT, not just a subset of samples.
Collect results for every epoch checkpoint.

Step 2 – Tables
Prepare new tables for inference evaluation:
Table 1: Inference rate results (FPS or ms/frame across full testing sequences).
Table 2: Evaluation results (IoU, Precision, AUC) for each epoch checkpoint.

Step 3 – Graphs
Prepare new graphs for inference evaluation:
Graph 1: Line graph showing IoU / Precision / AUC vs Epoch.

Step 4 – Report (assignment_4.docx)
The report must include:
The inference tables and graphs.
A link to the team’s GitHub repository containing the project.
A reflection section: each student contributes at least one paragraph on what they learned about SeqTrack inference and evaluation.

Submission
All deliverables must be placed inside a unified project folder named assignment_4 and must include:
assignment_4.docx (with tables, graphs, GitHub repo link, and reflections).
Inference log file (including optional time statistics if added).
Submit the folder:
On the team leader’s GitHub repository.
In the team’s private channel.

Grading (100%)
